# Discord.js Template Bot
This is another template bot for discord.js. Quick reminder about [discord.js guide](https://discordjs.guide) and how great of a place it is for documentation.

# Setup
1) Clone or fork the code so you can work on it.
2) Create a new discord application in the [developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a bot.
3) Make sure you have [installed node](https://nodejs.org/en/).
4) Navigate to the folder with the bots code and run `npm i`, this will install the following dependencies:
    ```
    discord.js
    dotenv
    fs
    ms
    nodemon
    ```
5) You can now start the bot by running the [`run.bat`](https://github.com/GrantBGreat/discord.js-template-bot/blob/main/run.bat) file (linux users can use the [`run.sh`](https://github.com/GrantBGreat/discord.js-template-bot/blob/main/run.sh) file) **OR** running `node .` in the bot's root folder.<br>
    **NOTE:** For bot development, you may want to use nodemon, more information on that can be found in the [developement readme](https://github.com/GrantBGreat/discord.js-template-bot/blob/main/commands/README.md).
6) Copy the discord token given for the bot:

7) After running the bot once, a `.env` (environmental) file will be created. Inside it you will see `TOKEN=your_token_here`, replace `your_token_here` with the token you just copied **and save the file!**<br>
    Example: `TOKEN=NzgwNjM4NTYyNTY3MDYxNTM2.X7yAUA.W6sjNFvgosqDurfdPXG0AZyyRpQ`
8) You are now done the initial setup of your own discord bot! Congrats and fun coding! ðŸ¥³

# Config
You will notice a config.json file in the root directory, this file stores the main config for the bot. You can find each option and what they are below:<br>
`prefix` -- This is the prefix for the bot as a string.<br>
`status` -- This is the status the bot appears with, your options for this are `online` (default), `dnd` (do not disturb), `idle`, and `invisible` (shows as offline).<br>
`statusmessage` -- This is the message that appears in the bot's custom status.<br>
`cooldown` -- This is the amount of time you must wait between commands. The time is in milliseconds and the default is 2000 (2 seconds).

# Developing the bot
Developing using this bot template is quite easy. You dont need to make any changes to the bot.js and it's all ready for you to just start adding command files in the [commands](https://github.com/GrantBGreat/discord.js-template-bot/tree/main/commands) folder. In addition to this, 3 basic example commands, including a help command are provided.

Full instructions on how to edit the commands and create new ones can be found [here](https://github.com/GrantBGreat/discord.js-template-bot/blob/main/commands/README.md).
